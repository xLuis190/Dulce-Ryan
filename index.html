              <p>Once he got his approval he was missing the most important Yes! Dulce’s. So Ryan decided to include her family in his plans and together they planed a trip to Jamaica Beach, Texas. With a photo shoot as an excuse, Ryan convince her to travel to Galveston where all our families were reunited to celebrate.

                While the happy couple was at the photo session, all family came out for a Big Surprise! Dulce cannot believe what she saw, all her family together including her brother who she hasn’t seen over a year was there. Dulce is excited and Ryan was preparing to ask the question.
                
                “Come here I love you! with all my heart, you mean the world to me, will you marry me?” and there he was, on his knee, holding the ring.
                
                Then Dulce say Yes!
                
                We all spent the weekend at the beach house.
